# Reconciliation: React Under The Hood

# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

## 1. Demonstrate React's Reconciliation Process:
   Illustrate how React efficiently updates the UI by comparing and updating the Virtual DOM based on changes in the application's state.

## 2. Teach Fundamental React Concepts:
   Provide a hands-on experience in building a simple React project to reinforce concepts like state management, rendering, and event handling.

## 3. Showcase Performance Optimization:
   Emphasize how React's reconciliation process enhances performance by selectively updating the Real DOM, particularly in scenarios with complex UIs and frequent updates.


# What's Reconciliation?

In React, the reconciliation process is a pivotal mechanism ensuring the optimization of UI updates. It revolves around the comparison and subsequent updating of the Virtual DOM, predicated on alterations in the application's state.
