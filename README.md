# Reconciliation: React Under The Hood

# Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

## 1. Demonstrate React's Reconciliation Process:
   Illustrate how React efficiently updates the UI by comparing and updating the Virtual DOM based on changes in the application's state.

## 2. Teach Fundamental React Concepts:
   Provide a hands-on experience in building a simple React project to reinforce concepts like state management, rendering, and event handling.

## 3. Showcase Performance Optimization:
   Emphasize how React's reconciliation process enhances performance by selectively updating the Real DOM, particularly in scenarios with complex UIs and frequent updates.


# What's Reconciliation?

In React, the reconciliation process is a pivotal mechanism ensuring the optimization of UI updates. It revolves around the comparison and subsequent updating of the Virtual DOM, predicated on alterations in the application's state.

## Key Steps in React's Reconciliation

### 1. State Change Initiates Reconciliation

When a state change transpires within the application, React initiates the creation of a new Virtual DOM. This newly constructed representation mirrors the updated state of the UI.

### 2. Diffing Algorithm - Identifying Discrepancies

Employing a diffing algorithm, React meticulously assesses disparities between the recently generated Virtual DOM and its predecessor. The objective is to pinpoint the minimal set of operations necessitated for the modification of the actual DOM.

### 3. Selective Update of the Real DOM

Armed with the knowledge of discrepancies, React strategically applies modifications solely to the pertinent sections of the actual DOM. This judicious approach circumvents the need for a wholesale reconstruction of the UI.
