# Reconciliation: React Under The Hood

## Overview

Welcome to "Inside the React Reconciler," an exploratory project designed to demystify React's reconciliation process. This repository offers a hands-on learning experience, unraveling the intricacies of React's core mechanism through the creation of a minimalist Todo app.

## Learning Goals

- **Understanding React Reconciliation:** Delve into the inner workings of React's reconciliation, a critical process ensuring efficient updates to the user interface by selectively modifying only the necessary components.
  
- **Practical Implementation:** Gain practical insights by implementing a simplified reconciler within the context of a Todo app. This practical application provides a deeper understanding of how React manages and optimizes the virtual DOM for performance.
  
- **Code Exploration:** Examine the project's codebase to grasp the conceptual implementation of React's reconciler. Uncover the logic behind the virtual DOM management and its seamless integration into a real-world application.

## Reconciliation Process

React's reconciliation is a multi-step process designed to intelligently update the virtual DOM and subsequently reflect these changes in the actual DOM. The process unfolds in three main stages:

1. **Render Virtual DOM:** Generate a virtual representation of the UI components, serving as an intermediary between the application's state and the actual DOM.

2. **Reconciliation (Diffing):** Compare the new virtual DOM with its previous state, identifying differences through a process known as "diffing." This step calculates the most efficient way to transition from the old state to the new state.

3. **Update DOM:** Apply the calculated changes to the real DOM, minimizing unnecessary updates and ensuring a performant user interface.

## Project Implementation

### Todo App

The project manifests the reconciliation process through a practical Todo app. Key components include:

- **`createElement` Function:** A utility function responsible for dynamically creating virtual DOM elements, a crucial aspect of React's component architecture.

- **Rendering Todo List:** Explore how the reconciler renders and updates the Todo list based on user interactions, providing a tangible example of React's dynamic UI capabilities.

- **Deletion Functionality:** Witness the reconciliation process in action when deleting Todo items, showcasing how React intelligently updates the UI while maintaining optimal performance.

### How React Works Under the Hood

By analyzing this project's codebase, you'll gain valuable insights into:

- **Virtual DOM Management:** Understand how React constructs and manages a virtual representation of the DOM, enabling efficient updates.

- **Efficient Updates:** Explore the mechanisms employed to update the actual DOM with precision, minimizing unnecessary changes and enhancing overall application performance.

- **Event Delegation:** Grasp the concept of event delegation, a key strategy for handling user interactions and ensuring a responsive and scalable application.
